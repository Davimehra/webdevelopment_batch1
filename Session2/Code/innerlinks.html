      While it is true a narrative is a story, there is more in the telling of
      the story. The narrative, or story, needs to make the reader feel
      involved, teach a lesson, help get an idea across, or feel emotionally
      about it. The narrative needs to explain who is in the story, tell what is
      happening, and when it happened. The topic sentence needs to be clear so
      the readers know they are going to learn something from the story. The
      story itself is written in time, or chronological order, as the events
      occur. Common Transitional expressions used in a narrative paragraph are:
      after, finally, soon, as (soon as), later, then, before, meanwhile, upon,
      during, next, when, first, now, and while. A good way to plan for a well
      developed paragraph is to write out a topic sentence, then write events in
      chronological order and then write a conclusion. This is a good way to
      make sure you stay on topic and that all the events are in the correct
