      The purpose of Pattern Based Writing: Quick & Easy Essay is to quickly and
      easily teach students how to organize information and make points clear.
      Then in the Writing with Purpose section of the writing program, students
      learn to apply their new writing strategies to different types, kinds,
      genres, and modes of writing. The truth is that it’s quick and easy to get
      students to write many different types of paragraphs when they have the
      right foundation. Put simply, all of the different types and kinds of
      paragraphs simply involve layering on a different purpose or intent. When
      students have the right foundation, it’s just that simple. What are you
      trying to achieve in this paragraph and in your whole composition? What is
      your purpose right here? Do you wish to describe? Do you want to evaluate?
      Is your goal to narrate? Is your intent to persuade? When students don’t
      have a proper foundation, these questions don’t mean much to them. After
      Pattern Based Writing: Quick & Easy Essay, students say, “I get it! I
      finally get it! I can’t even read what I was writing before!”.
